# Thesis-Design-Clients-2017-2019

### About
This repository contains the documents, source codes of all the thesis and
EECE design I made from 2017 - 2019 during my stay in Mapua University. 
I started accepting  research and development projects during those years since 
I need money for personal and family issues.

Projects here are previously on separate repositories, I decided to compile it
to one place so that it will be more organized. I did that because all of my 
works here are still considered (for me) "low quality". I rushed most of it due 
to the number of requests and I'm still not strict enough to write high quality code.
Not all projects are recorded through those years, some files are also incomplete.

As of the time writing this README.md (2021), I improved my development skills a lot and 
I'm strict to write good quality code. Due to my number of experiences and frustrations,
I now practice proper coding style that is easier to read, maintain, and scale. 
I decided not to remove this projects from my repository so I'll still have a record.

I have my own ups and downs as working student, I have to manage my time well. I also
faced several issues with my clients that I decided to drop the project because of
a misconduct and delays in agreements that they didn't meet.

As of this time, I'm now an R&D Software Engineer working on multiple projects. Both 
employed and self-employed.

I won't update this repository. Feel free to take all files here a reference but 
please do give me a credit.
